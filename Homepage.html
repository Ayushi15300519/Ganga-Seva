            <p>
    
                The Namami Gange project is a flagship initiative launched by the Government of India in<br> 2014 to clean and rejuvenate the Ganga River. This ambitious program, with a budget of ₹20,000 crore,<br> aims to reduce pollution, conserve biodiversity, and promote sustainable river management. <br>Key components of the project include the construction of sewage treatment plants, river surface cleaning, <br>afforestation, and rural sanitation initiatives to curb direct waste discharge into the river.<br> The initiative also focuses on public awareness and community participation to ensure long-term success.<br> Through these efforts, Namami Gange seeks to restore the sacred river's ecological health<br> while preserving its cultural and economic significance.
