  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Ganga, revered as a sacred lifeline of India, flows through the heart of the nation, nurturing millions of lives and embodying profound cultural and spiritual significance. Originating from the Gangotri Glacier in the Himalayas, it traverses over 2,500 kilometers, supporting agriculture, industry, and communities along its banks. However, this mighty river faces an existential threat from rampant pollution, which has transformed its pristine waters into a conduit of contaminants. Industrial waste, untreated sewage, agricultural runoff, and ritualistic practices involving non-biodegradable offerings have collectively degraded the river’s ecosystem. The pollution of the Ganga is not merely an environmental crisis but a socio-cultural challenge that demands urgent attention. This report delves into the causes, consequences, and ongoing efforts to restore the river, emphasizing the need for collective action to preserve this invaluable natural and cultural heritage.

    <section>
      <h2>Causes of Pollution</h2>
      <p>
        The pollution of the Ganga is a multifaceted issue driven by a combination of human activities and systemic failures. One of the primary contributors is the discharge of untreated sewage from urban centers along the river. Cities like Kanpur, Varanasi, and Patna release millions of liters of sewage daily, overwhelming outdated or nonexistent treatment facilities. Industrial effluents, particularly from tanneries, textile factories, and chemical plants, introduce toxic heavy metals and carcinogenic substances into the river. These industries, concentrated in states like Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, often bypass environmental regulations, prioritizing profit over ecological responsibility. Agricultural runoff, laden with pesticides and fertilizers, further exacerbates the problem, leading to nutrient overload and algal blooms that deplete oxygen levels. Additionally, cultural and religious practices, while deeply meaningful, contribute significantly to pollution. Devotees often immerse non-biodegradable items such as plastic idols, flowers wrapped in plastic, and other offerings into the river, which accumulate and choke aquatic ecosystems. Open defecation, still prevalent in some rural areas along the river, and the disposal of solid waste directly into the Ganga add to the contamination. The lack of adequate waste management infrastructure and public awareness compounds these issues, making the river a repository of pollutants.

      <h2>Effects</h2>
      <p>
        The pollution of the Ganga has far-reaching consequences that affect ecosystems, human health, and economic activities. Aquatic life, including the endangered Ganges river dolphin and various fish species, faces severe threats due to toxic pollutants and reduced oxygen levels. Contaminated water disrupts the food chain, leading to the decline of biodiversity and the collapse of fisheries that local communities depend on. For humans, the health impacts are dire. Millions of people rely on the Ganga for drinking water, bathing, and irrigation, but its polluted state has led to a surge in water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. Heavy metals like lead, mercury, and arsenic, found in high concentrations in certain stretches of the river, pose long-term risks, including cancer and neurological disorders. Agriculture, a cornerstone of the Indian economy, is also adversely affected. Farmers using polluted water for irrigation report reduced crop yields and contaminated produce, which impacts food security and marketability. Beyond these tangible effects, the pollution of the Ganga erodes its spiritual sanctity, disheartening millions of devotees who view the river as a divine entity. The cumulative impact of these issues undermines the socio-economic fabric of the regions dependent on the river, highlighting the urgent need for remediation.

      <h2>Recent Research Findings on Ganga Pollution</h2>
      <p>
        Recent studies have illuminated the severe and evolving nature of pollution in the Ganga River. A comprehensive review published in 2018 ([Ganga Water Pollution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160412018308845)) noted a significant reduction in pesticide levels over the past decade, attributed to regulatory measures and the establishment of the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA). However, this progress is overshadowed by a marked increase in inorganic pollutants, particularly heavy metals such as chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and arsenic (As). These carcinogenic elements pose severe health risks to the millions who rely on the river for drinking water and daily needs, with Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal identified as the most contaminated states.
      </p>
      <p>
        Microbial contamination has also escalated, rendering the water unfit for domestic use in many stretches, particularly in the middle plains. During the Maha Kumbh 2025 ([Maha Kumbh 2025](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/maha-kumbh-2025-ganga-yamunas-long-term-sustainability-depends-on-continuous-monitoring-improved-wastewater-treatment-and-public-cooperation)), water quality tests revealed alarmingly high levels of faecal coliform bacteria at key bathing sites. For instance, at Sangam, the faecal coliform count reached 49,000 MPN/100 ml, far exceeding the safe bathing limit of 2,500 MPN/100 ml. Similar elevated levels were recorded at Deeha Ghat and Old Naini Bridge, highlighting the acute pollution crisis during large gatherings.
      </p>
      <p>
        A detailed study conducted in Varanasi in 2024 ([Varanasi Water Quality](https://iwaponline.com/wpt/article/19/4/1099/100433/Assessing-the-water-quality-of-River-Ganga-in)) assessed water quality across nine sampling points, analyzing parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and coliform counts. The findings indicated that the river water is alkaline, with high coliform concentrations and elevated BOD and COD levels, particularly downstream. The Water Quality Index (WQI) classified several sites as poor to unsuitable for bathing and drinking, with sites S8, S9, and S2 being the most polluted. The Nemerow Pollution Index (NPI) further confirmed high pollution levels, especially for COD and total coliform, with seasonal variations showing better quality during the monsoon due to dilution.
      </p>
      <p>
        These findings underscore the critical need for immediate and sustained action to mitigate pollution, protect public health, and preserve the Ganga’s ecological and cultural significance.

      <h2>Government Initiatives</h2>
      <p>
        Recognizing the critical state of the Ganga, the Indian government has launched several initiatives to address its pollution. The Ganga Action Plan (GAP), initiated in 1986, was an early effort to clean the river by focusing on sewage treatment and industrial regulation. Despite limited success due to poor implementation and insufficient funding, it set the stage for more robust programs. The Namami Gange Programme, launched in 2014 with an initial budget of over ₹20,000 crore, later increased to ₹22,500 crore until 2026, is a flagship initiative aimed at reducing pollution through sewage treatment plants, riverfront development, and stricter industrial discharge norms. The program emphasizes public participation, encouraging sustainable practices to curb direct pollution. Additional efforts include the establishment of the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) to oversee project implementation and biodiversity conservation programs to protect endangered species like the Ganges river dolphin. The government has also targeted illegal industrial units and promoted eco-friendly religious offerings, such as biodegradable idols.
      </p>
      <h3>Progress and Challenges as of 2025</h3>
      <p>
        As of January 2025 ([Namami Gange Projects](https://ddnews.gov.in/en/namami-gange-programme-over-300-projects-completed-rs-40000-crore-invested-in-rejuvenating-river-ganga/)), the Namami Gange Programme has initiated 492 projects worth ₹40,121.48 crore, with 307 completed and operational, particularly in sewage infrastructure, where 127 of 206 projects are finished. However, a PRS Legislative Research analysis ([Namami Gange Slow Progress](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2025/Feb/25/think-tank-flags-slow-progress-in-namami-gange-project-only-69-of-funds-used)) indicates that only 69% of allocated funds have been utilized, and sewage treatment capacity is at 52% of the targeted 7,000 million liters per day (MLD). Over 450 industries still fail to meet pollution norms, contributing to ongoing contamination. Despite these challenges, positive developments include reported improvements in water quality and aquatic life revival, as highlighted by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath during Mahakumbh 2025 ([Mahakumbh Success](https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/mahakumbh-2025-validates-namami-ganges-success-up-cm-yogi20250323182158/)). Addressing fund utilization bottlenecks and enforcing industrial compliance remain critical for sustained progress.
      </p>

      <h2>Role of Communities and NGOs</h2>
      <p>
        The role of communities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in cleaning the Ganga is pivotal, complementing government efforts with grassroots action. Organizations like the Sankat Mochan Foundation and Ganga Seva Samiti have been instrumental in monitoring water quality, advocating for policy reforms, and educating communities about sustainable practices. These NGOs collaborate with scientists and local leaders to implement innovative solutions, such as bio-remediation for sewage treatment and campaigns promoting waste segregation. Community-driven initiatives, including river clean-up drives and tree-planting along riverbanks, foster a sense of ownership among residents. Religious leaders, leveraging their influence in the Ganga basin, have encouraged eco-friendly rituals, such as using biodegradable materials for offerings. These efforts bridge the gap between policy and practice, demonstrating the power of collective action in restoring the Ganga’s health.
